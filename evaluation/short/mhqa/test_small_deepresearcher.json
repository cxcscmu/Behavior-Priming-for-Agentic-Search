These phrases are sung to music given in the Missal , as is the choir 's response , Deo gratias or ( after Requiescant in pace ) Amen . In the Episcopal Church 's Book of Common Prayer , the service ends with the celebrant saying , `` Go in peace to love and serve the Lord .

    "answer": "Serialized fiction surged in popularity during Britain 's Victorian era , due to a combination of the rise of literacy , technological advances in printing , and improved economics of distribution . Most Victorian novels first appeared as installments in monthly or weekly periodicals . The wild success of Charles Dickens 's The Pickwick Papers , first published in 1836 , is widely considered to have established the viability and appeal of the serialized format within periodical literature . During that era , the line between `` quality '' and `` commercial '' literature was not distinct . Other famous writers who wrote serial literature for popular magazines were Wilkie Collins , inventor of the detective novel with The Moonstone and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , who created the Sherlock Holmes stories originally for serialization in The Strand magazine .<|answer_split|>improved economics of distribution<|answer_split|>technological advances in printing<|answer_split|>the rise of literacy",

    "answer": "With a pH of approximately 2 , chyme emerging from the stomach is very acidic . The duodenum secretes a hormone , cholecystokinin ( CCK ) , which causes the gall bladder to contract , releasing alkaline bile into the duodenum . CCK also causes the release of digestive enzymes from the pancreas . The duodenum is a short section of the small intestine located between the stomach and the rest of the small intestine . The duodenum also produces the hormone secretin to stimulate the pancreatic secretion of large amounts of sodium bicarbonate , which then raises pH of the chyme to 7 . The chyme then enters the jejunum , where the useful portion of it is transformed into chyle . ( As the material moves through the jejunum and ileum , digestion progresses , and the nonuseful portion will continue onward into the large intestine . ) The duodenum is protected by a thick layer of mucus and the neutralizing actions of the sodium bicarbonate and bile .<|answer_split|>pyloric valve<|answer_split|>the pyloric valve",

MON testing uses a similar test engine to that used in RON testing , but with a preheated fuel mixture , higher engine speed , and variable ignition timing to further stress the fuel 's knock resistance . Depending on the composition of the fuel , the MON of a modern pump gasoline will be about 8 to 12 octane lower than the RON , but there is no direct link between RON and MON . Pump gasoline specifications typically require both a minimum RON and a minimum MON .",

Initially at 146.5 metres ( 481 feet ) , the Great Pyramid was the tallest man - made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years . Originally , the Great Pyramid was covered by limestone casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface ; what is seen today is the underlying core structure . Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still be seen around the base . There have been varying scientific and alternative theories about the Great Pyramid 's construction techniques . Most accepted construction hypotheses are based on the idea that it was built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place .<|answer_split|>a 10 - to 20 - year period<|answer_split|>over a 10 - to 20 - year period",

    "question": "in most plants phototropism is thought to occur because",
    "answer": "Phototropism is the growth of an organism which responds to a light stimulus . It is most often observed in plants , but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi . The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a chemical called auxin that reacts when phototropism occurs . This causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light . Phototropism is one of the many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli . Growth towards a light source is called positive phototropism , while growth away from light is called negative phototropism ( skototropism ) . Most plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism , and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth . Roots usually exhibit negative phototropism , although gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth . Some vine shoot tips exhibit negative phototropism , which allows them to grow towards dark , solid objects and climb them . The combination of phototropism and gravitropism allow plants to grow in the correct direction .",

    "answer": "Plumes are postulated to rise through the mantle and begin to partially melt on reaching shallow depths in the asthenosphere by decompression melting . This would create large volumes of magma . The plume hypothesis postulates that this melt rises to the surface and erupts to form `` hot spots '' .<|answer_split|>A mantle plume is an upwelling of abnormally hot rock within the Earth 's mantle , first proposed by J. Tuzo Wilson in 1963 . As the heads of mantle plumes can partly melt when they reach shallow depths , they are often invoked as the cause of volcanic hotspots , such as Hawaii or Iceland , and flood basalts such as the Deccan and Siberian traps . Some such volcanic regions lie far from tectonic plate boundaries , while others represent unusually large - volume volcanism near plate boundaries or in large igneous provinces .<|answer_split|>A mantle plume is posited to exist where hot rock nucleates at the core - mantle boundary and rises through the Earth 's mantle becoming a diapir in the Earth 's crust . The currently active volcanic centers are known as hotspots . In particular , the concept that mantle plumes are fixed relative to one another , and anchored at the core - mantle boundary , would provide a natural explanation for the time - progressive chains of older volcanoes seen extending out from some such hot spots , such as the Hawaiian -- Emperor seamount chain .",

However , in modern society it is becoming a practice to wear rings for engagements and not for actual marriage . Though the left hand is considered inauspicious for religious activities , a ring ( not to be called wedding ring ) is still worn on the left hand . Men generally wear the rings on the right hand and the women on the left hands . If a wedding ring is worn , the ring is worn on the left ring finger mostly for men .",

    "question": "puella magi madoka magica when does madoka become a magical girl",
    "answer": "My Very Best Friend<|answer_split|>No . Title End Card Original airdate 01 `` As If I Met Her in My Dream ... '' `` Yume no Naka de Atta , Yō na ... '' ( 夢 の 中 で 会っ た 、 よう な ... ) Hanokage January 7 , 2011 After having a strange dream , Madoka Kaname is surprised to find the girl from her dream , Homura Akemi , enroll into her school the next day . Seemingly knowing her already , Homura warns Madoka to stay the way she is , lest she risk losing everything . Later that day , when Madoka goes shopping with her friend , Sayaka Miki , Madoka hears a strange voice , leading her to a backroom area . There , she encounters a strange creature named Kyubey being attacked by Homura , who is revealed to be a magical girl . As Homura demands Madoka stay away from Kyubey , Sayaka arrives and escapes with Madoka , only for them to be caught in a mystical barrier and approached by strange monsters . They are rescued by another magical girl named Mami Tomoe , who dispels the attackers using her magic abilities . Homura then appears again and is confronted by Mami who tells her that she will overlook the attack on Kyubey as she does not wish to fight in front of the other girls . Homura then promptly leaves . Kyubey is healed by Mami 's powers and then explains that he wishes to form a contract with Madoka and Sayaka to make them magical girls . 02 `` That Would Be Truly Wonderful '' `` Sore wa Tottemo Ureshii Natte '' ( それは とっても 嬉しい なっ て ) Hekiru Hikawa January 14 , 2011 Mami and Kyubey explain to Madoka and Sayaka that Kyubey has the power to grant wishes , but in exchange , those who make wishes must become magical girls to fight witches , who are born from curses . Mami offers to take Madoka and Sayaka with her on a witch hunt to help each decide if there were a wish they would risk their lives for . The next day , Kyubey , who can not be seen by normal people , accompanies Madoka and Sayaka to school , where they learn to communicate with each other telepathically . Homura visits Madoka once again to repeat her warning , and refuses to answer when Madoka asks what her wish was . After school , Madoka , Sayaka and Mami follow the aura of the witch from the previous day to an abandoned building , where they manage to save a woman controlled by a witch from committing suicide . They then enter a portal inside the building where Mami finds and defeats the witch responsible , earning a Grief Seed which can be used to recover magical power . 03 `` I 'm Not Afraid of Anything Anymore '' `` Mō Nani mo Kowakunai '' ( もう 何 も 怖く ない ) Santa Tsuji January 21 , 2011 Sayaka visits an injured boy named Kyōsuke Kamijō , who was a violin player she admired when she was little . After defeating a witch 's familiar , Mami tells Madoka and Sayaka that she had been involved in a traffic accident and did not have time to think about her wish . She also lets Sayaka know about the precedents for wishing on behalf of other people . Later that night , as Madoka helps her mother and talks with her father , Mami is approached by Homura , who warns her about making Madoka a magical girl . The next day while visiting the hospital , Madoka and Sayaka find a Grief Seed that is close to activating , so Sayaka and Kyubey enter the portal ahead of them while Madoka finds Mami . As Madoka and Mami catch up with them , Homura tries to warn Mami about the witch , but Mami binds her to stop her from following them . As they continue , Madoka mentions her wish is to simply be a magical girl and help others . Mami laments that her job as a magical girl has left her lonely and afraid , but feels happy that Madoka wishes to fight alongside her . As the Grief Seed activates , Mami goes into action and starts to fight against the witch . However , the witch suddenly transforms into a huge caterpillar which decapitates and instantly kills Mami right before Madoka 's eyes . Homura , her bonds dissolving with Mami 's demise , steps in and defeats the witch , claiming the Grief Seed , leaving behind a mortified Madoka and a heavily resentful Sayaka . 04 `` Miracles and Magic Are Real '' `` Kiseki mo , Mahō mo , Arun da yo '' ( 奇跡 も 、 魔法 も 、 ある ん だ よ ) Jin Kobayashi January 28 , 2011 As Sayaka continues to be concerned about Kyōsuke , Madoka , still in despair over the death of Mami , admits she is too scared to become a magical girl , so Kyubey decides to let her be . Madoka is approached by Homura , who tells her that Mami , along with other magical girls she has seen die during her time , will only be considered missing by normal people . Madoka says she will never forget Mami or the fact that Homura saved her life , though Homura warns her that her kindness may turn against her . As Kyōsuke becomes more frustrated and desperate about his condition , which keeps him from being able to use his fingers to play the violin , Sayaka decides to contract with Kyubey . Out in the city , Madoka notices several people , including her classmate Hitomi Shizuki , infected by the witch 's kiss and preparing to kill themselves by mixing cleaning agents . When Madoka thwarts their attempted suicide , they chase her to a closet where she is caught by a witch who tortures her with memories of Mami 's death . Just then , she is rescued by Sayaka , who had become a magical girl after using her wish to cure Kyōsuke 's hand , much to the shock of Homura . Elsewhere , Kyubey greets another magical girl named Kyōko Sakura , who just came to the city , unhappy that Sayaka took over the area Mami once looked after . 05 `` There 's No Way I 'll Ever Regret It '' `` Kōkai nante , Aru Wakenai '' ( 後悔 なんて 、 ある わけ ない ) Yupon February 4 , 2011 Both Madoka and Homura show concern about Sayaka 's decision to become a magical girl . Sayaka visits Kyōsuke and feels happy that he is finally able to play his violin once again . Madoka asks Homura to become friends with Sayaka , not wanting her to suffer the same fate as Mami , though Homura 's words , that those who become magical girls can not be saved , do nothing to comfort her . Later that day , Madoka joins Sayaka on patrol , where they find a witch 's familiar , but it escapes when Sayaka 's attacks are blocked by Kyōko , who only cares about collecting Grief Seeds from mature witches . Kyōko 's selfishness angers Sayaka , and the two magical girls clash violently , with Madoka unable to do anything to stop them . As Kyōko gets the upper hand , Madoka considers using her wish to stop the fighting , but Homura steps in before she can do so . 06 `` This Just Ca n't Be Right '' `` Konna no Zettai Okashii yo '' ( こんな の 絶対 おかしい よ ) Hajime Ueda February 11 , 2011 Homura knocks Sayaka unconscious and gets Kyōko to leave , before reiterating to Madoka that she should not get involved , even telling her to give up on Sayaka . Kyubey mentions to Sayaka about the potential Madoka has to become a magical girl , but Sayaka insists that she does n't want Madoka to get involved . Homura confronts Kyōko , mentioning that something known as Walpurgisnacht is approaching in two weeks , to which Kyōko agrees to form an alliance with her to fight against it . Madoka becomes concerned about Sayaka , who ignores her pleas to try talking with Kyōko , also showing hatred towards Homura , whom she blames for Mami 's death . The next evening , Sayaka is once again confronted by Kyōko who goads her into another fight on top of a highway bridge . Before the battle can begin , Madoka arrives and throws Sayaka 's Soul Gem , the source of her magic energy , off the bridge in the hope of stopping the fight . However , this causes Sayaka to suddenly become lifeless , shocking both Madoka and Kyōko . Kyubey reveals that as part of the contract , the Soul Gem literally contains a magical girl 's soul , while their body is merely a shell that can only be controlled within 100 metres of the Soul Gem . Homura rushes to retrieve the Soul Gem and brings it back to Sayaka , reviving her . 07 `` Can You Face Your True Feelings ? '' `` Hontō no Kimochi to Mukiaemasu ka ? '' ( 本当 の 気持ち と 向き合え ます か ? ) Takashi Tensugi February 18 , 2011 Sayaka gets angry at Kyubey for keeping the truth from her , but he keeps her in check by making her feel the pain she would have otherwise felt while fighting Kyōko . The next day , Madoka asks Homura about the meaning behind Kyubey 's actions and why she never told them . Kyōko talks with Sayaka , taking her to a church which belonged to her father before he was excommunicated for his controversial beliefs . She explains how she made a contract with Kyubey so that people would listen to her father 's sermons , but when he found out about her wish , he broke down and killed himself and his family , leaving Kyōko alone . Sayaka apologizes to Kyōko but refuses to listen to her advice to live for herself . The next day , Kyōsuke returns to school , but Sayaka avoids talking to him . Hitomi confronts her about it and reveals she is also in love with Kyōsuke , giving Sayaka one day to confess to him before she does . Sayaka breaks down in front of Madoka , believing that she can never be with Kyōsuke as she feels she is no longer human . As Sayaka fights against a witch that night , she ignores Kyōko 's help and recklessly attacks the witch without regard to the damage caused to her body , laughing maniacally . 08 `` I Was Stupid , So Stupid '' `` Atashitte , Honto Baka '' ( あたし っ て 、 ほんと バカ ) Takuya Fujima February 25 , 2011 Sayaka defeats the witch , but refuses to take the Grief Seed it produces . Madoka tries to reason with Sayaka , who just berates her , blaming her for her state before running off . As Homura and Kyōko discuss Walpurgisnacht , Kyubey approaches them , mentioning that something bad will happen if Sayaka 's Soul Gem is not cleansed . Sayaka does not return home that night and just watches as Hitomi makes her confession to Kyōsuke the next day , sending her further into despair . Homura approaches her in an attempt to offer a Grief Seed , but Sayaka once again rejects it as she does not trust her . To spare Madoka the suffering of watching Sayaka 's downfall , Homura prepares to kill her , but Kyōko intervenes , helping Sayaka escape . Kyubey coerces Madoka into making a wish to save Sayaka , but Homura shoots him before she can do so , breaking down before Madoka and telling her not to be so self - sacrificing . Madoka gets the feeling she has met Homura somewhere before , but leaves to search for Sayaka , while a replacement Kyubey appears , identifying Homura , who knows his true identity , as a being from a different timeline . Kyōko finds Sayaka , who is implied to have just killed two men on the train . Sayaka admits her stupidity before her Soul Gem , having turned completely dark , shatters and transforms into a Grief Seed . Elsewhere , Kyubey muses that as a ' woman ' who has yet to mature is called a ' girl ' , the term ' magical girl ' only makes sense for it to be a prelude to whomever has yet to become a ' witch ' . 09 `` I 'd Never Allow That to Happen '' `` Sonna no , Atashi ga Yurusanai '' ( そんな の 、 あたし が 許さ ない ) Namaniku ATK March 4 , 2011 As a witch appears before Kyōko , Homura arrives and uses her time manipulation to help Kyōko escape , bringing Sayaka 's body to Madoka . Homura reveals that the witch was actually Sayaka , whose Soul Gem had transformed into a Grief Seed as a result of becoming too tainted with despair . Later that night , Kyubey appears before Madoka again , explaining that his race , known as Incubators , choose girls in their teens and raise them to become witches in order to obtain powerful energy from the transition from hope to despair in an effort to prevent the heat death of the universe . Incubators are coldly logical , with emotion considered an illness . Thus the process is only feasible with humans , especially adolescent girls . Desperately clinging to the hope that there may still be a way to save Sayaka , Kyōko asks Madoka to help her in an attempt to reach Sayaka 's human feelings and try to obtain her Soul Gem from the witch . As the two enter the portal to confront the witch , Kyōko takes the majority of its attacks while Madoka tries to reach Sayaka with words . However , when Sayaka ends up attacking Madoka as well , Kyōko has Homura get Madoka to safety while she sacrifices herself to destroy Sayaka . Kyubey , who had clearly known there was no way of saving Sayaka , taunts Homura , saying that with Kyōko gone , she will not be able to stop Walpurgisnacht without Madoka becoming a magical girl . 10 `` I Wo n't Rely on Anyone Anymore '' `` Mō Dare ni mo Tayoranai '' ( もう 誰 に も 頼ら ない ) Kuroe Mura March 11 , 2011 The episode looks at an alternate timeline in which Homura is a shy transfer student who makes friends with the cheerful Madoka . Lacking confidence in herself , having been in hospital for the past six months , Homura is attacked by a witch but is rescued by Madoka and Mami , both of whom are magical girls . When both Madoka and Mami are killed in the battle against Walpurgisnacht , Homura makes a contract with Kyubey to send her back in time so that she can protect Madoka . She joins Madoka and Mami and learns how to use her magical powers for combat , stopping time whilst using stolen firearms and explosives . However , following the battle against Walpurgisnacht , Homura witnesses Madoka transforming into a witch and realizes Kyubey had been deceiving everyone . She attempts to tell the others during the next time loop , but they do not believe her , until Sayaka becomes a witch and the remaining magical girls are forced to kill her . After the battle , Mami kills Kyōko and turns her gun on Homura in an attempt to prevent them from becoming witches . Madoka stops Mami with deadly force , leaving just her and Homura to face Walpurgisnacht . With their Soul Gems depleted , Madoka uses her last Grief Seed on Homura , begging her to return to the past to keep her from being fooled by Kyubey . She then asks Homura to kill her before she turns into a witch . Returning to the past again , now with a colder personality , Homura attempts to keep Kyubey from making contact with Madoka in the first place and decides to fight against the witches herself . However , this ultimately fails , and she continues to travel through many timelines in the hope of saving Madoka . 11 `` The Only Thing I Have Left to Guide Me '' `` Saigo ni Nokotta Michishirube '' ( 最後 に 残っ た 道しるべ ) Buriki April 21 , 2011 Kyubey reveals to Homura that the reason Madoka has the potential to become such a powerful witch is because Homura 's constant trips through time to try and save Madoka has resulted in her becoming the centerpoint of countless timelines , as the potential of a magical girl is determined by the relative effect of their role on fate . After Sayaka 's funeral , Kyubey shows Madoka the history of magical girls and how it has shaped civilization , causing extreme distress to Madoka . Madoka 's mother , Junko , grows concerned about her , feeling she is hiding something from her . Madoka goes to see Homura , who unconvincingly reassures her that she can handle Walpurgisnacht , and finally reveals the truth about herself , begging Madoka to allow Homura to protect her . As a storm hits the city , and the citizens take shelter , Homura stands alone to face Walpurgisnacht , throwing everything she has at it , but even so she is still overwhelmed and eventually is all but defeated . When Madoka hears from Kyubey that Homura may turn into a witch if the latter loses hope of saving her , Madoka prepares to go and find her . Although Junko tries to stop her , Madoka convinces her that she is doing what she believes is the right thing . As Homura begins to lose hope and is on the verge of becoming a witch , Madoka arrives with Kyubey , announcing that she plans to make her wish . 12 `` My Very Best Friend '' `` Watashi no , Saikō no Tomodachi '' ( わたし の 、 最高 の 友達 ) Ume Aoki April 21 , 2011 Madoka makes the decision to become a magical girl , wishing to prevent all witches from the past , present and future from coming into existence in the first place , a wish made possible by the massive power inside her . As she makes the transformation , her consciousness is greeted by Mami and Kyōko . Becoming a god - like entity and defeating Walpurgisnacht , Madoka spreads herself across space and time , preventing fallen magical girls from becoming witches by absorbing their despair and having them disappear peacefully . Homura is taken to a place outside of time where she witnesses Madoka exterminating the witch born from her own comet - sized Soul Gem . In doing this , Madoka starts to fade into a higher plane of existence , present at all points in all spacetimes but absent from human memory and perception . Madoka leaves Homura with a ribbon so that she will not forget her . Madoka then leaves and joins Sayaka , who ultimately had to succumb to a magical girl 's fate as Madoka had chosen to respect the wish she made to heal Kyosuke . Homura returns to a world where Madoka does not exist , Mami and Kyōko are still alive , but only Homura retains memories of Madoka . She and other magical girls continue to fight against wraiths formed from the negative emotions of humanity , but thanks to Madoka 's efforts , magical girls disappear instead of becoming witches after exhausting their hope . Despite being alone and facing these new enemies , Homura remains firm in protecting the city that Madoka loved .",

The first recorded use of the term `` liberal arts '' ( artes liberales ) occurs in De Inventione by Marcus Tullius Cicero , but it is unclear if he created the term . Seneca the Younger discusses liberal arts in education from a critical Stoic point of view in Moral Epistle 88 . The exact classification of the liberal arts varied however in Roman times , and it was only after Martianus Capella in the 5th century AD influentially brought the seven liberal arts as bridesmaids to the Marriage of Mercury and Philology , that they took on canonical form .<|answer_split|>artes liberales<|answer_split|>liberalia studia<|answer_split|>`` liberal pursuits '' ( Latin liberalia studia )",

Ayyadurai is notable for his controversial claim to be the `` inventor of email '' , based on the electronic mail software called `` EMAIL '' he wrote as a New Jersey high school student in the late 1970s . Initial reports that repeated Ayyadurai 's assertion -- from organizations such as The Washington Post and the Smithsonian Institution -- were followed by public retractions . These corrections were triggered by objections from historians and ARPANET pioneers who pointed out that email was already actively used in the early 1970s .",

    "question": "attitudes of a person toward some object or idea are highly resistant to change",
    "answer": "Important factors that influence the impact of emotional appeals include self - efficacy , attitude accessibility , issue involvement , and message / source features . Attitudes that are central to one 's being are highly resistant to change while others that are less fixed may change with new experiences or information . A new attitude ( e.g. to time - keeping or absenteeism or quality ) may challenge existing beliefs or norms so creating a feeling of psychological discomfort known as cognitive dissonance . It is difficult to measure attitude change since attitudes may only be inferred and there might be significant divergence between those publicly declared and privately held . Self - efficacy is a perception of one 's own human agency ; in other words , it is the perception of our own ability to deal with a situation . It is an important variable in emotional appeal messages because it dictates a person 's ability to deal with both the emotion and the situation . For example , if a person is not self - efficacious about their ability to impact the global environment , they are not likely to change their attitude or behaviour about global warming .",

    "question": "an american colonist who did not support the fight for independence",
    "answer": "Loyalists were American colonists who remained loyal to the British Crown during the American Revolutionary War . At the time they were often called Tories , Royalists , or King 's Men . They were opposed by the Patriots , those who supported the revolution and called them `` persons inimical to the liberties of America '' . Prominent Loyalists repeatedly assured the British government that many thousands of loyalists would spring to arms and fight for the crown . The British government acted in expectation of that , especially in the southern campaigns in 1780 - 81 . In practice , the number of loyalists in military service was far lower than expected . Across the colonies , Patriots watched suspected Loyalists very closely , and would not tolerate any organized Loyalist opposition . Many outspoken or militarily active loyalists were forced to flee , especially to their stronghold of New York City . William Franklin , the royal governor of New Jersey and son of Patriot leader Benjamin Franklin , became the leader of the Loyalists after his release from a Patriot prison in 1778 . He worked to build Loyalist military units to fight in the war , but the number of volunteers was much fewer than London expected .",

    "question": "what is the meaning of lord shiva lingam",
    "answer": "Lingam ( Sanskrit : लिंगम् , IAST : liṅgaṃ , lit . `` sign , symbol or mark '' ; also linga , Shiva linga ) , is an abstract or aniconic representation of the Hindu deity Shiva , used for worship in temples , smaller shrines , or as self - manifested natural objects . In traditional Indian society , the linga is seen as a symbol of the energy and potential of Shiva himself .<|answer_split|>reminds of the Omnipotent Lord<|answer_split|>The Hindu scripture Shiva Purana describes the origin of the lingam , known as Shiva - linga , as the beginning-less and endless cosmic pillar ( Stambha ) of fire , the cause of all causes . Lord Shiva is pictured as emerging from the Lingam -- the cosmic pillar of fire -- proving his superiority over the gods Brahma and Vishnu . This is known as Lingodbhava . The Linga Purana also supports this interpretation of lingam as a cosmic pillar , symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva . According to the Linga Purana , the lingam is a complete symbolic representation of the formless Universe Bearer -- the oval - shaped stone is the symbol of the Universe , and the bottom base represents the Supreme Power that holds the entire Universe in it . A similar interpretation is also found in the Skanda Purana : `` The endless sky ( that great void which contains the entire universe ) is the Linga , the Earth is its base . At the end of time the entire universe and all the Gods finally merge in the Linga itself . '' In yogic lore , the linga is considered the first form to arise when creation occurs , and also the last form before the dissolution of creation . It is therefore seen as an access to Shiva or that which lies beyond physical creation . In the Mahabharata , at the end of Dwaraka Yuga , Lord Shiva says to his disciples that in the coming Kali Yuga , He would not appear in any particular form , but instead as the formless and omnipresent .",

Weiss April 17 , 2011 ( 2011 - 04 - 17 ) 2.22 In the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros , a soldier of the ancient Night 's Watch order survives an attack by supernatural creatures known as the White Walkers , thought until now to be myth . He rushes to Castle Winterfell , which is ruled by Eddard `` Ned '' Stark , Warden of the North , who decapitates the soldier for deserting his post . In King 's Landing , the capital , Jon Arryn , the `` Hand of the King '' , dies under mysterious circumstances . King Robert Baratheon , Ned 's longtime friend , travels to Winterfell , offering the position to him and also proposing marriage between his firstborn son Joffrey and Ned 's older daughter Sansa . Ned 's wife Catelyn receives a letter from her sister Lysa , Jon Arryn 's widow , saying that she has escaped King 's Landing and that Jon was murdered by the Lannisters , Queen Cersei 's family . Catelyn burns the letter and tells Ned about it , believing that the Lannisters are plotting against Robert . Ned 's 10 - year - old son , Brandon , climbs a tower , where he witnesses Cersei having sex with her twin brother , Jaime , who then pushes him out the window from a presumably fatal height . Meanwhile across the narrow sea in Essos , the exiled Prince Viserys Targaryen makes a deal with the Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , who marries Viserys ' younger sister , Daenerys , in exchange for an army to conquer Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne . `` The Kingsroad '' Tim Van Patten David Benioff & D.B.

When Joffrey threatens Arya and her friend , Arya 's direwolf defends her and escapes , provoking a conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters . To resolve the insult , Robert orders Ned to execute Sansa 's direwolf . In Winterfell , Brandon awakens from unconsciousness .

During China 's Qin Dynasty , records have shown that officials took hand prints , foot prints as well as finger prints as evidence from a crime scene . In China , around 300 CE , handprints were used as evidence in a trial for theft . By 650 , the Chinese historian Kia Kung - Yen remarked that fingerprints could be used as a means of authentication . In his Jami al - Tawarikh ( Universal History ) , the Persian physician Rashid - al - Din Hamadani ( also known as `` Rashideddin '' , 1247 -- 1318 ) refers to the Chinese practice of identifying people via their fingerprints , commenting : `` Experience shows that no two individuals have fingers exactly alike .

In the First Party System , only Alexander Hamilton 's Federalist Party and Thomas Jefferson 's Democratic - Republican Party were significant political parties . Toward the end of the First Party System , the Republicans dominated a one - party system ( primarily under the Presidency of James Monroe ) . Under the Second Party System , the Democratic - Republican Party split during the election of 1824 into Adams ' Men and Jackson 's Men . In 1828 , the modern Democratic Party formed in support of Andrew Jackson . The National Republicans were formed in support of John Quincy Adams . After the National Republicans collapsed , the Whig Party and the Free Soil Party quickly formed and collapsed . In 1854 , the modern Republican Party formed from a loose coalition of former Whigs , Free Soilers and other anti-slavery activists . Abraham Lincoln became the first Republican president in 1860 .",

    "answer": "The idea of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) is to make it illegal for companies and their supervisors to influence foreign officials with any personal payments or rewards . The FCPA applies to any person who has a certain degree of connection to the United States and engages in foreign corrupt practices . The Act also applies to any act by U.S. businesses , foreign corporations trading securities in the U.S. , American nationals , citizens , and residents acting in furtherance of a foreign corrupt practice whether or not they are physically present in the U.S. This is considered the nationality principle of the act . Any individuals that are involved in those activities may face prison time . This act was passed to make it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business . In the case of foreign natural and legal persons , the Act covers their deeds if they are in the U.S. at the time of the corrupt conduct . This is considered the protective principle of the act . Further , the Act governs not only payments to foreign officials , candidates , and parties , but any other recipient if part of the bribe is ultimately attributable to a foreign official , candidate , or party . These payments are not restricted to monetary forms and may include anything of value . This is considered the territoriality principle of the act .",

The dam was later renamed the Hoover Dam during the Truman administration . Work started on the dam in 1931 and Las Vegas ' population swelled from around 5,000 citizens to 25,000 , with most of the newcomers looking for a job building the dam . However , the demographic of the work force consisting of males from across the country with no attachment to the area created a market for large scale entertainment . A combination of local Las Vegas business owners , and Mafia crime lords helped develop the casinos and showgirl theaters to entertain the largely male dam construction workers .<|answer_split|>Realizing that gambling would be profitable for local business , the Nevada state legislature legalized gambling at the local level in 1931 . Las Vegas , with a small but already well - established illegal gambling industry , was poised to begin its rise as the gaming capital of the world . The county issued the first gambling license in 1931 to the Northern Club , and soon other casinos were licensed on Fremont Street like the Las Vegas Club and the Apache Hotel . Fremont Street became the first paved street in Las Vegas and received the city 's first traffic light in 1931 .<|answer_split|>1931",

District Court of Kansas reversed .<|answer_split|>declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional<|answer_split|>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 ( 1954 ) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional . The decision effectively overturned the Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896 , which allowed state - sponsored segregation , insofar as it applied to public education . Handed down on May 17 , 1954 , the Warren Court 's unanimous ( 9 -- 0 ) decision stated that `` separate educational facilities are inherently unequal . '' As a result , de jure racial segregation was ruled a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution . This ruling paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the Civil Rights Movement , and a model for many future impact litigation cases . However , the decision 's fourteen pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools , and the Court 's second decision in Brown II ( 349 U.S. 294 ( 1955 ) ) only ordered states to desegregate `` with all deliberate speed '' .",

    "answer": "North Atlantic Ocean<|answer_split|>Titanic was planned to arrive at New York Pier 54 on the morning of 17 April . After leaving Queenstown Titanic followed the Irish coast as far as Fastnet Rock , a distance of some 55 nautical miles ( 63 mi ; 102 km ) . From there she travelled 1,620 nautical miles ( 1,860 mi ; 3,000 km ) along a Great Circle route across the North Atlantic to reach a spot in the ocean known as `` the corner '' south - east of Newfoundland , where westbound steamers carried out a change of course . Titanic sailed only a few hours past the corner on a rhumb line leg of 1,023 nautical miles ( 1,177 mi ; 1,895 km ) to Nantucket Shoals Light when she made her fatal contact with an iceberg . The final leg of the journey would have been 193 nautical miles ( 222 mi ; 357 km ) to Ambrose Light and finally to New York Harbor .",

    "question": "what is the first basic process in the light reaction of photosynthesis",
    "answer": "Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species , the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centres that contain green chlorophyll pigments . In plants , these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts , which are most abundant in leaf cells , while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane . In these light - dependent reactions , some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances , such as water , producing oxygen gas . The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that act as an immediate energy storage means : reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) and adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , the `` energy currency '' of cells .<|answer_split|>one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron<|answer_split|>energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centres that contain green chlorophyll pigments<|answer_split|>Photosynthesis occurs in two stages . In the first stage , light - dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy - storage molecules ATP and NADPH . During the second stage , the light - independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide .",

    "answer": "primarily concentrated in the Southern United States<|answer_split|>as far east as Richmond , Virginia<|answer_split|>as far west as Las Vegas<|answer_split|>as far north as Indianapolis and Denver<|answer_split|>According to figures gathered by Statista , a market data and statistics portal , while combined private labels sold more , in 2014 Blue Bell was the best - selling ice cream brand in the United States . The sales area is primarily concentrated in the Southern United States , and has been sold as far west as Las Vegas , as far north as Indianapolis and Denver , and as far east as Richmond , Virginia . Overall , this area comprises only 20 % of the United States . By comparison , each of Blue Bell 's top four competitors sells its products in over 86 % of the United States . To become one of the three biggest ice cream manufacturers , Blue Bell has consistently been the top seller in the majority of the markets the company has entered . For example , in its home state of Texas , the company has a 52 % market share . Within five months of its entry into Baton Rouge , Louisiana , the company had garnered 35 % of the ice cream market . People living outside the sales area can have the ice cream shipped to them ( although this has temporarily been halted while the company is ramping up production after the recalls ) , and former President George W. Bush ( a former Governor of Texas ) often had the ice cream shipped to Camp David during his administration . In 2006 and 2012 , astronauts aboard the International Space Station were also treated to Blue Bell ice cream `` to help out ( the crew 's ) happiness quotient . ''",

    "question": "where does trick or treat for unicef money go",
    "answer": "In 1953 , the United States Committee for UNICEF , now called the U.S. Fund for UNICEF , started actively promoting the program . By the 1960s , the concept had expanded throughout the United States , with small orange collection boxes distributed to millions of trick - or - treaters . When UNICEF won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965 , U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson said in his congratulatory letter : `` Your UNICEF Trick or Treat Day has helped turn a holiday too often marred by youthful vandalism into a program of basic training in world citizenship . '' In 1967 , Johnson declared Halloween , October 31 , to be ' UNICEF Day ' in the United States ; by 1969 , 3.5 million American children were trick - or - treating for donations . Children ( and adults ) in the U.S. have collected more than US $ 175 million for Trick - or - Treat for UNICEF . Donations to Trick - or - Treat for UNICEF support UNICEF 's global programing , but in 2005 , half of the proceeds were targeted to a domestic cause , aiding victims of Hurricane Katrina . In 2008 , the U.S. Fund for UNICEF introduced mobile phone text message donations as well as a MySpace and Facebook page . In 2014 , the U.S. Fund for UNICEF partnered with Crowdrise to expand the campaign 's online presence , allowing participants to create personal fundraising web pages in addition to traditional door - to - door trick - or - treating .<|answer_split|>UNICEF 's global programing",

The drivers that were the fastest qualifiers for the previous year 's races ' during Busch Second Round Qualifying were eligible for one wild card spot . The wild card driver was selected by blind draw during the week of the NASCAR awards banquet or during the January media tour . From 1995 -- 1996 , the winner of the most pole positions in the secondary NASCAR Busch Series won an entry into the Busch Clash , driving a Busch - sponsored car . David Green won the right both times . 1998 -- 2000 : Pole position winners from the previous season clinched automatic berths . Drivers eligible from Second Round Qualifying participated in the Bud Shootout Qualifier , with the winner advancing to the main event Bud Shootout . 2001 : Pole position winners from the previous season clinched automatic berths . In addition , all former winners of the event not already qualified received automatic berths . NASCAR eliminated second round qualifying beginning in 2001 and the Shootout Qualifier was eliminated . For the 2001 Shootout only , the drivers eligible from second round qualifying of 2000 events were placed in a blind draw for the final wild card starting position , as had been done from 1979 -- 1997 . 2002 -- 2008 : Pole position winners from the previous season clinched automatic berths . All former winners of the event not already qualified received automatic berths . 2009 : The field consists of 28 cars . The top six teams from each manufacturer ( Ford , Chevrolet , Dodge , and Toyota ) based on owners ' points from the previous season clinch berths , for a total of 24 cars . Previous season 's pole position winners no longer were a qualifying factor . Unlike previous formats , the entry receives the berth , not the driver . In addition , each of the four manufacturers receive one `` wild card '' berth for a car / driver not already qualified , to bring the grand total to 28 cars . The other four `` entries '' were for previous champions and past Shootout winners . This system was discarded after only one year as it was largely unpopular . 2010 -- 2011 : A new qualifying format was introduced , which expanded the field , with no size limitations : The 12 drivers from the previous season 's Chase Previous Budweiser Shootout winners Previous points - paying winners at Daytona ( Daytona 500 or Coke Zero 400 ) Previous Sprint Cup champions The last 10 Rookies of year ( in 2010 , it was only the reigning rookie of the year ) 2012 : The field was once again expanded . Automatic bids went to the top 25 in series points ( every driver from defending series champion Tony Stewart through 25th place Brian Vickers ) , as well as any Daytona race winner who was not otherwise qualified and who competed in at least one race in 2011 ( which enabled Bill Elliott , Geoff Bodine , Derrike Cope , Michael Waltrip , Jamie McMurray , Trevor Bayne , Terry Labonte , and Ken Schrader to make the race if they decide to run ) . 2013 -- 2014 : The Unlimited format returned to the format used from 2002 - 2008 , with all drivers who won pole positions via time trials ( does not include winners of practice one , should qualifying not be held because of inclement weather ) and previous Unlimited / Shootout winners that have attempted to qualify for any of the 36 points races in the previous season . Because of the new race sponsor , the beer sticker mandate was eliminated by the track . 2015 -- 2016 : Eligibility was once again changed , with a minimum of 25 eligible entries . Automatic eligibility now goes to : The 16 drivers from the previous year 's Chase ; e.g. in the 2016 Unlimited , every driver from defending 2015 series champion Kyle Busch through 16th place Clint Bowyer qualified ; with the exception of Jeff Gordon , who retired . Drivers who won pole positions via knockout qualifying ( excluding winners of practice one , should qualifying be rained out ) Previous Unlimited winners that attempted to qualify for any of the 36 points races in the previous season Previous Daytona 500 front row starters ( both inside and outside polesitters ) if they did not win a pole position at any of the other 35 races during the previous season Any remaining spots are filled by the highest drivers in the previous season 's final point standings to not be automatically entered into the Unlimited on any of the other qualifications 2017 -- present :* Unlike previous years , the starting field for the 2017 Clash will not be a predetermined number of cars ; rather , the field is limited to drivers who meet more exclusive criteria . Only drivers who were 2016 Pole Award winners , former Clash race winners , former Daytona 500 pole winners who competed full - time in 2016 , and drivers who qualified for the 2016 Chase are eligible . It should be noted that in the 2017 Clash , Daniel Suarez was allowed to race since Joe Gibbs Racing already had a car prepared for Carl Edwards who surprisingly retired just a month before the race .<|answer_split|>former Clash race winners",

Realizing that this is a new start as a family , Belle tells Gold that this is their happy beginning . Snow then sees the `` Once Upon a Time '' storybook reappear . Henry looks at the final page of the storybook which suddenly writes itself with the words `` When both good and evil did the right thing , faith was restored and the final battle was won . '' Snow reminds everyone that the story is n't over .

When Gold finds Gideon 's heart he is tempted by a manifestation of the Darkness , which takes the form of his Enchanted Forest counterpart , Rumplestiltskin . The Dark One manifestation tells him to let Gideon kill Emma so he can finally have it all : power and love . The manifestation reminds Gold of what Fiona told him , that if Emma dies his Dark Magic will increase exponentially . After it 's all over he can spend all the time he wants exploring the world with Belle and / or destroying it . Gold resists temptation and chooses to do the right thing and tries to use Gideon 's heart to stop him from killing Emma . However Fiona 's spell keeps him from being able to free Gideon and instead Gideon 's heart stops beating and dims . The manifestation taunts Gold before disappearing and Gold heads out to Belle who consoles him for trying to do the right thing . Back at the intersection , Emma and Gideon fight with Emma acknowledging her role as the Savior to protect those she loves , protect the innocent and to spread light and hope no matter what the cost . Realizing what she must do , Emma throws down her sword and Gideon apologizes and kills her releasing an enormous blast of light magic , ending the Final Battle and causing Gideon to disappear .<|answer_split|>In the episode , Henry and Emma work together to defeat the Black Fairy ; in The Enchanted Forest , Snow , David , Hook , Regina , Zelena , the Queen , Aladdin , and Jasmine team up to save the worlds from being destroyed .",

    "question": "difference between deep cycle and starting marine battery",
    "answer": "A deep - cycle battery is a lead - acid battery designed to be regularly deeply discharged using most of its capacity . In contrast , starter batteries ( e.g. most automotive batteries ) are designed to deliver short , high - current bursts for cranking the engine , thus frequently discharging only a small part of their capacity . While a deep - cycle battery can be used as a starting battery , the lower `` cranking current '' implies that an oversized battery may be required .<|answer_split|>Alloys used for the plates in a deep cycle battery may contain more antimony than that of starting batteries<|answer_split|>Deep - cycle lead - acid batteries generally fall into two distinct categories ; flooded ( FLA ) and valve - regulated lead - acid ( VRLA ) , with the VRLA type further subdivided into two types , Absorbed Glass Mat ( AGM ) and Gel . The reinforcement of absorbed glass mat separators helps to reduce damage caused by spilling and jolting vibrations . Further , flooded deep - cycle batteries can be divided into subcategories of Tubular - plated Opzs or flat plated . The difference generally affects the cycle life and performance of the cell . The structural difference between deep - cycle batteries and cranking batteries is in the lead battery plates . Deep cycle battery plates have thicker active plates , with higher - density active paste material and thicker separators . Alloys used for the plates in a deep cycle battery may contain more antimony than that of starting batteries . The thicker battery plates resist corrosion through extended charge and discharge cycles .",

    "question": "what was the purpose of a revival meeting during the second great awakening",
    "answer": "In the newly settled frontier regions , the revival was implemented through camp meetings . These often provided the first encounter for some settlers with organized religion , and they were important as social venues . The camp meeting was a religious service of several days ' length with preachers . Settlers in thinly populated areas gathered at the camp meeting for fellowship as well as worship . The sheer exhilaration of participating in a religious revival with crowds of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people inspired the dancing , shouting , and singing associated with these events . The revivals followed an arc of great emotional power , with an emphasis of the individual 's sins and need to turn to Christ , restored by a sense of personal salvation . Upon their return home , most converts joined or created small local churches , which grew rapidly . The Second Great Awakening marked a religious transition in society in America . Many Americans from the Calvinist sect emphasized man 's inability to save themselves and that their only way to be saved was from grace from God .<|answer_split|>evangelizing<|answer_split|>The revivals enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations . Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new millennial age . The Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ .",

The disease was mild for a number of years until it either mutated or a more aggressive strain was introduced around 1950 . Within 12 years , the amount of land under papaya production dropped 94 % . Production was then moved from Oahu to the Puna region of Hawaii island ( the `` Big Island '' ) under strict quarantine . In 1971 PRSV was found in home gardens but efforts were taken to prevent its spread . The virus emerged in commercial farms in 1992 and by 1995 production in Puna was impossible . Commercial growers again relocated to the Hamakua coast but with only limited success . Hawaiian papaya production was halved by the end of the decade . Transgenic papaya varieties that are resistant to PRSV entered production in 1998 and resuscitated the industry .<|answer_split|>Papaya ringspot virus ( PRSV )",

Tony is also eager to represent Jane at her disbarment hearing but later turns her down when he learns she was married to Ethan during the course of their relationship and that she was married to Ethan so he could be on her insurance .

After confronting Tony and essentially embarrassing herself in front of them , Tony later angrily informs her that that was a job interview and she probably ruined his chances at getting the job . He then breaks up with her for good . The two then enter a very heated battle in court when Tony represents a man being sued for having two wives at the same time while Jane represents the women but in the end Jane wins the case . They then make up and their relationship heats up again only to be ended when Tony tells her that he got the job in Washington D.C. and asks her to move with him but she declines .

He is shocked to learn that his brother 's wife is unfaithful ; discovering that his own wife 's infidelity has been even more flagrant , he has her killed . In his bitterness and grief , he decides that all women are the same . Shahryār begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning , before she has a chance to dishonour him . Eventually the vizier , whose duty it is to provide them , can not find any more virgins . Scheherazade ( Arabic : شهرزاد ‎ , from Middle Persian čehr / lineage + āzād / noble ) , the vizier 's daughter , offers herself as the next bride and her father reluctantly agrees . On the night of their marriage , Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale , but does not end it . The king , curious about how the story ends , is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion . The next night , as soon as she finishes the tale , she begins ( and only begins ) a new one , and the king , eager to hear the conclusion of this tale , postpones her execution once again . So it goes on for 1,001 nights .",

It is a relic of a pagan custom , namely , the winter solstice which in Europe occurs in December . This was celebrated in ancient Rome with gift - giving during the Saturnalia holiday , which took place that month . As Christianity became increasingly widespread in the Roman lands , the custom of gift - giving continued . Around the year 336 AD the date of December 25 appears to have become established as the day of Jesus 's birth , and the tradition of gift - giving was reinterpreted and tied to the story of three Magi giving gifts to baby Jesus ; together with another story , that of Santa Claus based on the historical figure of Saint Nicholas , a fourth - century Greek bishop and gift - giver , it slowly became a part of Christmas celebrations .",

'' The `` old lover '' has been variously interpreted to be either Simon 's ex-wife Peggy Harper , from whom he was recently divorced , his former girlfriend from the 1960s Kathy Chitty , or even Simon 's former musical partner Art Garfunkel , who appears on the song that follows ' Still Crazy After All These Years '' on the album . After sharing a few beers , the singer and the old lover part ways again . The singer notes that he is `` not the kind of man who tends to socialize '' but rather leans `` on old familiar ways '' and is `` still crazy after all these years . '' The lyrics acknowledge a nostalgia for the past , but also subtly suggest that once the sweet nostalgia is gone , it is replaced by loneliness and even bitterness .",

Wells<|answer_split|>Huxley said that Brave New World was inspired by the utopian novels of H.G. Wells , including A Modern Utopia ( 1905 ) and Men Like Gods ( 1923 ) . Wells 's hopeful vision of the future 's possibilities gave Huxley the idea to begin writing a parody of the novel , which became Brave New World . He wrote in a letter to Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith , an American acquaintance , that he had `` been having a little fun pulling the leg of H.G. Wells , '' but then he `` got caught up in the excitement of ( his ) own ideas . '' Unlike the most popular optimist utopian novels of the time , Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future . Huxley referred to Brave New World as a `` negative utopia '' , somewhat influenced by Wells 's own The Sleeper Awakes ( dealing with subjects like corporate tyranny and behavioural conditioning ) and the works of D.H.

Goodman & Andrew Chambliss May 7 , 2017 ( 2017 - 05 - 07 ) 2.87 In the past , Snow makes a wish that grants the entire Enchanted Forest the ability to use the gift of song as a strength , which also spreads to Oz as well . When Regina becomes affected by the wish , she finds a way to end it before the first curse takes place , but the Blue Fairy , who granted Snow the wish , tells Snow and David that the wish will be part of Emma 's destiny . In Emma 's past , her chance to make use of her talent is held back by being told she 'll be alone . This would come back to taunt Emma in the present day , as Fiona returns to use that weakness to take Emma 's heart before unleashing a new curse on her wedding day , with help from Gold by freezing her family . When Henry discovers the page in the book that reveals the song in Emma 's heart will make her stronger , not only does it embolden Emma , it stops Fiona from crushing her heart , but Fiona still tells Emma that the battle will continue . On her wedding day , Emma and Hook finally marry , just in time for the dark clouds of the Black Fairy 's curse to erupt from the clock tower and engulf them at 6 : 00 PM , setting up the final battle . 132 133 21 22 `` The Final Battle '' Steve Pearlman Ralph Hemecker Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz May 14 , 2017 ( 2017 - 05 - 14 ) 2.95 Fiona 's curse alters Storybrooke , institutionalizing Emma and leaving only Henry and Gold `` awake , '' while sending Emma 's other allies to their home realms . The Final Battle begins over Emma 's belief ; if she stops believing in the realms of story , they will be consumed by the Darkness and cease to exist . If all the realms are destroyed , Fiona would gain unchecked powers and be able to break the Laws of Magic at will . In the Enchanted Forest , the banished characters gather at Regina 's castle ; David and Hook obtain a magic bean and the Evil Queen sacrifices herself , holding off the Darkness to delay the group 's destruction . Fiona convinces Emma to destroy the book , but Henry hand - draws one that restores her belief in time to save everyone in the castle . Gold kills Fiona , who had hidden Belle and turned her into a coward ; this breaks the Curse , which restores everyone 's memories and reunites them in Storybrooke . However , Gideon is still under orders to kill Emma . Gold attempts to free Gideon 's heart ; however , a spell cast by the Black Fairy prevents him from doing so . Emma lays down her sword , allowing Gideon to impale her ; this releases Emma 's light magic and ends the battle . With both Gold and Emma having chosen good , Gideon is returned to infancy and the realms are restored , and those who died in the crisis are revived . The characters embark on their `` happy beginnings . '' Many years later in the New Enchanted Forest , an adult Henry vanishes while defending his daughter Lucy from an unidentified entity . Guided by Tiger Lily , Lucy travels to Seattle , where Henry no longer remembers her .",

    "answer": "to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body<|answer_split|>The peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) is one of the two components of the nervous system , the other part is the central nervous system ( CNS ) . The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic .",

    "answer": "Renishaw Hall , Derbyshire , England , UK was the setting for Pemberley in the 1980 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul , adapted from the novel by Fay Weldon . Lyme Park , near Stockport , was the setting for Pemberley for the 1995 television series of Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth . Chatsworth House , the original inspiration for Pemberley , was used for the exterior scenes for Joe Wright 's 2005 film version of Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen . However , Wilton House was used for many of the interior scenes , such as those featuring Georgiana Darcy . Jane Austen mentions Chatsworth in the novel as one of the great houses Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle visited before Pemberley during their visit north . The Duchess of Devonshire believes that the author was thinking of Chatsworth House when describing Pemberley due to the great number of similarities between Chatsworth and Pemberley . Chatsworth was again used for exterior , and some interior , scenes for the BBC adaptation of Death Comes to Pemberley . Harewood House , near Leeds in West Yorkshire , was the setting for Pemberley in the ITV fantasy series Lost in Austen . This series was not a direct adaptation of the novel , but the novel provided the majority of the plots , characters and inspiration . Some interior scenes in the BBC adaptation of Death Comes to Pemberley were filmed at Harewood . Pemberley Press is the name of the publishing house that Bridget Jones works at in the 2001 film Bridget Jones 's Diary , in homage to Pride and Prejudice . In The Lizzie Bennet Diaries , a vlog - style modern adaptation of Pride and Prejudice , Pemberley Digital is the name of Darcy 's company . Darcy says Pemberley is the name of the place that his father 's family comes from in England .<|answer_split|>Renishaw Hall , Derbyshire , England , UK",

    "question": "why is the cockerel the symbol of france",
    "answer": "Its association with France dates back from the Middle Age and is due to the play on words in Latin between Gallus , meaning an inhabitant of Gaul , and gallus , meaning rooster , or cockerel . Its use , by the enemies of France , dates to this period , originally a pun to make fun of the French , the association between the rooster and the Gauls / French was developed by the kings of France for the strong Christian symbol that the rooster represents : prior to being arrested , Jesus predicted that Peter would deny him three times before the rooster crowed on the following morning . At the rooster 's crowing , Peter remembered Jesus 's words . Its crowing at the dawning of each new morning made it a symbol of the daily victory of light over darkness and the triumph of good over evil . It is also an emblem of the Christian 's attitude of watchfulness and readiness for the sudden return of Christ , the resurrection of the dead , and the final judgment of humankind .

Honorary appointees who later become a citizen of a Commonwealth realm can convert their appointment from honorary to substantive , then enjoy all privileges of membership of the order , including use of the title of Sir and Dame for the senior two ranks of the Order . An example is Irish broadcaster Terry Wogan , who was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Order in 2005 , and on successful application for British citizenship , held alongside his Irish citizenship , was made a substantive member and subsequently styled as Sir Terry Wogan .",

The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war -- no territorial aggrandizement ; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people , self - determination ; restoration of self - government to those deprived of it ; reduction of trade restrictions ; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all ; freedom from fear and want ; freedom of the seas ; and abandonment of the use of force , as well as disarmament of aggressor nations . Adherents of the Atlantic Charter signed the Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942 , which became the basis for the modern United Nations .",

    "question": "who selects the delegates that attend the national conventions",
    "answer": "The nature of Democratic ( and Republican ) conventions has changed considerably since 1972 . Every 4 years , the nominees are essentially selected earlier and earlier in the year , so the conventions now officially ratify the nominees instead of choose them . ( Even the close race of 2008 , which was not decided until early June , did not change the modern function of the convention ) . The 1980 convention was the last convention for the Democrats that had even a sliver of doubt about who the nominee would be . ( Ted Kennedy forced a failing vote to free delegates from their commitment to vote for Jimmy Carter ) . The 1976 convention was the last where the vice-presidential nominee was announced during the convention , after the presidential nominee was chosen . ( Carter choosing Walter Mondale . ) After the `` ugly '' conventions of 1968 and 1972 , the parties realized it was in their interests to show a unified party to the nation during the convention , and to try to eliminate any dissent . And as the conventions became less interesting , and television ratings have generally declined ( as they have on average for all television shows ) , the networks have cut back their coverage significantly , which in turn has forced the parties to manage what is televised even more closely .",

    "question": "when did they start assigning social security numbers at birth",
    "answer": "Before 1986 , people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14 , since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes , and those under that age seldom had substantial income . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction . Before this act , parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported . During the first year of the Tax Reform Act , this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed . The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents . In 1988 , the threshold was lowered to 2 years old , and in 1990 , the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old . Today , an SSN is required regardless of the child 's age to receive an exemption . Since then , parents have often applied for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth ; today , it can be done on the application for a birth certificate .<|answer_split|>1990",

    "question": "where will you see polaris in north pole",
    "answer": "Because Polaris lies nearly in a direct line with the axis of the Earth 's rotation `` above '' the North Pole -- the north celestial pole -- Polaris stands almost motionless in the sky , and all the stars of the northern sky appear to rotate around it . Therefore , it makes an excellent fixed point from which to draw measurements for celestial navigation and for astrometry . The moving of Polaris towards and , in the future , away from the celestial pole , is due to the precession of the equinoxes . The celestial pole will move away from α UMi after the 21st century , passing close by Gamma Cephei by about the 41st century , moving towards Deneb by about the 91st century . Historically , the celestial pole was close to Thuban around 2750 BC , and during classical antiquity it was closer to Kochab ( β UMi ) than to Polaris . It was about the same angular distance from β UMi as to α UMi by the end of late antiquity . The Greek navigator Pytheas in ca . 320 BC described the celestial pole as devoid of stars . However , as one of the brighter stars close to the celestial pole , Polaris was used for navigation at least from late antiquity , and described as ἀεί φανής ( aei phanēs ) `` always visible '' by Stobaeus ( 5th century ) , and it could reasonably be described as stella polaris from about the High Middle Ages .",

However , the savings rate and rate of technological progress remain unexplained . Endogenous growth theory tries to overcome this shortcoming by building macroeconomic models out of microeconomic foundations . Households are assumed to maximize utility subject to budget constraints while firms maximize profits . Crucial importance is usually given to the production of new technologies and human capital . The engine for growth can be as simple as a constant return to scale production function ( the AK model ) or more complicated set ups with spillover effects ( spillovers are positive externalities , benefits that are attributed to costs from other firms ) , increasing numbers of goods , increasing qualities , etc .",

    "question": "what is the average time in hospice care",
    "answer": "Many physicians are slow to refer to hospice care , waiting until they are absolutely certain of a terminal prognosis . Some physicians believe that the patient must have a six - month prognosis or less to receive hospice care , while others are overly optimistic in their assessment of prognosis , presuming treatment will be more effective than it is . As a result , the majority of patients are referred to hospice in the very end - stages of their diseases , or choose that time to seek hospice care . The average length of stay in hospice before a patient dies was 26 days in 1994 and 19 days in 1998 . Although the length of average stays has since increased , the term of care continues to be underused . In 2004 the average stay was 57 days and the median length was 22 days . 33 % of hospice patients admitted in 2004 died within seven days of admission .<|answer_split|>57 days",

    "question": "what is the main difference between lymph and interstitial fluid",
    "answer": "Interstitial fluid forms at the arterial ( coming from the heart ) end of capillaries because of the higher pressure of blood compared to veins , and most of it returns to its venous ends and venules ; the rest ( up to 10 % ) enters the lymph capillaries as lymph . Thus , lymph when formed is a watery clear liquid with the same composition as the interstitial fluid . However , as it flows through the lymph nodes it comes in contact with blood , and tends to accumulate more cells ( particularly , lymphocytes ) and proteins .<|answer_split|>Lymph is the fluid that circulates throughout the lymphatic system . The lymph is formed when the interstitial fluid ( the fluid which lies in the interstices of all body tissues ) is collected through lymph capillaries . It is then transported through larger lymphatic vessels to lymph nodes , where it is cleaned by lymphocytes , before emptying ultimately into the right or the left subclavian vein , where it mixes back with the blood .<|answer_split|>Since the lymph is derived from the interstitial fluid , its composition continually changes as the blood and the surrounding cells continually exchange substances with the interstitial fluid . It is generally similar to blood plasma , which is the fluid component of blood . Lymph returns proteins and excess interstitial fluid to the bloodstream . Lymph may pick up bacteria and bring them to lymph nodes , where they are destroyed . Metastatic cancer cells can also be transported via lymph . Lymph also transports fats from the digestive system ( beginning in the lacteals ) to the blood via chylomicrons .",

Official English title Original Japanese title Animation director Writer Original airdate Ref `` Beginner '' `` Biginā '' ( 素人 ( ビギナー ) ) Kōji Ōdate Jukki Hanada April 9 , 2014 Sora and Shiro are two siblings and are known in online games as the undefeated group named The Blank . In real life , they are hikikomori who are ostracized by the world . One day , they receive a challenge from Tet to a game of chess and are victorious . In response he offers to send them to a world which revolves around games and they accept , believing it to be a joke . They are then summoned to a reality known as Disboard where a spell , known as the Ten Pledges , prevents violence and enforces the rules and outcomes of games . They travel to Elkia , the nation inhabited by humans , where Sora plays poker against a woman for her money and wins by out - cheating her . He and Shiro rest at an inn and decide their next goal is to find a home . `` Challenger '' `` Charenjā '' ( 挑戦 者 ( チャレンジャー ) ) Masaru Koseki Jukki Hanada April 16 , 2014 Stephanie Dola , granddaughter of Elkia 's deceased king , loses against Kurami Zell in a contest to decide the next ruler ; she then confronts Sora for not revealing how her opponent was cheating .

She challenges Sora to blackjack in hopes of binding him to the Pledges to perform his duties ; she attempts to use false shuffling but loses due to card counting . Understanding her predicament , Sora trumps the nobles and uses the previous game to have Stephanie act like a dog . Stephanie tries several more games on Sora to take responsibility as Elkia 's king but fails . Sora and Shiro reveal they were not slacking , but are researching ways to conquer the other nations ; in response Stephanie redirects them to Elkia 's library which is owned by the flügel Jibril . 6 `` Interesting '' `` Intaresutingu '' ( 一手 ( インタレ スティング ) ) Kunihiko Hamada Kento Shimoyama May 14 , 2014 Sora and Shiro challenge Jibril by betting their tablet computer full of books ; considering it of high value , Jibril offers her freedom in exchange .

From the game , Sora and Shiro deduce Disboard 's scientific research is lacking , and uses this knowledge to their advantage ; they succeed after removing coulomb 's law and inducing a hypernova , removing Jibril from the game . Impressed by the two , Jibril solemnly pledges her loyalty to them . 7 `` Sacrifice '' `` Sakurifaisu '' ( 死に 手 ( サクリファイス ) ) Rie Harada Kakuto Gai Takashi Aoshima May 21 , 2014 Jibril shares her knowledge about the werebeasts , revealing they have been undefeated for decades and always take the memories of the game away from the opponents .

As the Eastern Federation makes preparations for the game , Sora waits for the missing piece needed for victory ; the next day , Shiro realizes everyone has forgotten about Sora . 9 `` Sky Walk '' `` Sukai Wōku '' ( 解離 法 ( スカイ ・ ウォーク ) ) Masaki Hyuga Jukki Hanada June 4 , 2014 Believing Shiro 's memories have been tampered with , Jibril arranges a chess game to remove the memories regarding Sora ; Shiro decides her memories are real and wins the match . After investigating , Shiro recalls Sora arranged a game of reversi with Kurami ; the game 's pieces consist of the components making up Sora and Kurami 's identity . Having lost most of his pieces , Sora was nearly erased from existence but the last three pieces allow Shiro to keep her memories of him . Shiro finds the pieces in her room and places them on an invisible board , winning the game and restoring Sora . From his victory , Sora shares his memories with Kurami , allowing them to form an alliance , and gains the right to manipulate Fil 's memories . 10 `` Blue Rose '' `` Burū Rōzu '' ( 指向 法 ( ブルー ・ ローズ ) ) Maria Ichino Takashi Nagayoshi Yumiko Kinoshita Kento Shimoyama June 11 , 2014 Sora and friends bond with Kurami and Fil as they make the final preparations to conquer the Eastern Federation .

While Stephanie remains clueless about the game , Sora , Shiro , and Jibril battle against Izuna and deduce that her grandfather , Ino Hatsuse , is relaying their location and state of mind to her . Sora and friends regroup as Shiro makes the proper adjustments to their plans . Executing the unspoken plan , Sora and Shiro corner Izuna , forcing her to use an ability called Blood Destruction to augment her abilities . 12 `` Rule Number 10 '' `` Rūru Nanbā Jū '' ( 収束 法 ( ルール ・ ナンバー ・ 10 ) ) Kōji Ōdate Kunihiko Hamada Jukki Hanada June 25 , 2014 Sora and Shiro are defeated ; as Izuna drops her guard , she is shot by Stephanie riding a NPC . Sora reveals he bound Stephanie to the Pledges to hide her intent while Shiro calculated the NPC 's movements , allowing Stephanie to hide her location . While Izuna laments the werebeasts ' fate , Sora assures her of his goodwill . Sora forces political pressure on the Eastern Federation leader , the nameless miko , to challenge him to a game . They have a coin flip where Sora has it land on its edge . He convinces the miko to declare they both win and as a result , Elkia can share resources with the Eastern Federation while the werebeasts maintain their self - rule ; the allied nation is named the Elkia Federation . In the aftermath , Sora and friends have the miko channel an old deus for a game .<|answer_split|>the sixth volume",

    "question": "where are muscle cells found in the body",
    "answer": "Skeletal muscle or `` voluntary muscle '' is anchored by tendons ( or by aponeuroses at a few places ) to bone and is used to effect skeletal movement such as locomotion and in maintaining posture . Though this postural control is generally maintained as an unconscious reflex , the muscles responsible react to conscious control like non-postural muscles . An average adult male is made up of 42 % of skeletal muscle and an average adult female is made up of 36 % ( as a percentage of body mass ) . Smooth muscle or `` involuntary muscle '' is found within the walls of organs and structures such as the esophagus , stomach , intestines , bronchi , uterus , urethra , bladder , blood vessels , and the arrector pili in the skin ( in which it controls erection of body hair ) . Unlike skeletal muscle , smooth muscle is not under conscious control . Cardiac muscle ( myocardium ) , is also an `` involuntary muscle '' but is more akin in structure to skeletal muscle , and is found only in the heart .",

    "answer": "The term was first used to describe nations with greater than great power status as early as 1944 , but only gained its specific meaning with regard to the United States , the United Kingdom and its empire and the Soviet Union after World War II . This was because the United Kingdom , the United States and the Soviet Union had proved themselves to be capable of casting great influence in global politics and military dominance . The term in its current political meaning was coined by Dutch - American geostrategist Nicholas Spykman in a series of lectures in 1943 about the potential shape of a new post-war world order . This formed the foundation for the book The Geography of the Peace , which referred primarily to the unmatched maritime global supremacy of the British Empire and United States as essential for peace and prosperity in the world .",

This story , often read as a parable , plays with the reality - illusion dichotomy that fascinated James , especially in the later stages of his career . For the illustrator who narrates the story , the genuine article proves all too useless for his commercial purposes .

It had a tune very similar to that used today but only the words `` Pop ! Goes the Weasel '' . The dance became extremely popular , and featured on stage as well as in dance - halls . By September of the same year the title was being used as a scornful riposte and soon words were added to an already well - known tune . The song is mentioned in November 1855 in a Church of England pamphlet where it is described as a universally popular song played in the streets on barrel organs , but with `` senseless lyrics '' : the use of alternative , more wholesome words is suggested . The following verse had been written by 1856 when it was quoted in a performance at the Theatre Royal .",

Cisco and Caitlin go to rescue the hostages , but get captured by Axel and Zoey , who intend to kill them . Ralph arrives , and attempts to shield the two from an acid shower , until Wells manages to hack into the shower system to neutralize its acidity . Iris visits Barry in prison , where they reaffirm their love for each other . Ralph and Cisco go to get coffee , where they meet the excitable girl from the wedding .

In prison , Barry learns that Ratchet is innocent of a robbery - homicide that was actually committed by Sylbert Rundine fifteen years prior . Barry asks the team to look into the case . Rundine turns out to be a bus meta with the ability to shrink and enlarge objects , and he shrinks Cisco and Ralph while escaping . Harry 's attempted cure backfires , and Caitlin determines that if they are not re-enlarged within a certain period of time , their bodies will explode . The team confronts Rundine at a warehouse , where Harry tricks him into re-enlarging Ralph and Cisco . Rundine is arrested , but refuses to confess to the earlier crime . Barry gathers that even if Ratchet went free , he would be as unhappy in the city as he is in prison ; he wishes to live in a secluded Chinese village called Jiaju , but fears he will never get there . Barry then uses his speed to take Ratchet to Jiaju , where he can live out his dream . After discovering Barry is the Flash , the prison 's warden , Gregory Wolfe , locks Barry in his private metahuman wing , intending to sell him to Amunet . 82 13 `` True Colors '' Tara Nicole Weyr Jonathan Butler & Gabriel Garza February 6 , 2018 ( 2018 - 02 - 06 ) T27. 13413 2.28 Wolfe plans to sell Barry and the imprisoned bus metas ( Ramsey Deacon , Becky Sharpe , Mina Chaytan , and Sylbert Rundine ) to Amunet , so they plan to escape . Cecile discovers Wolfe 's plans after reading his mind . Ralph encounters a former colleague and his negative interaction with him prompts the discovery that he can shapeshift . His lack of mastery of the new ability prevents his attempt to foil Amunet 's deal with Wolfe . Barry helps the metas escape the power dampeners , but they are cornered by Wolfe and Amunet . DeVoe arrives and again uses his chair to extract the metas ' abilities , before transferring his mind into Sharpe 's body . He then crushes Wolfe 's skull as Marlize looks on in horror ; Amunet flees . Ralph uses his shapeshifting ability to appear as the original DeVoe at Barry 's appeal , claiming that he was unconscious at Barry 's loft but not dead , which clears Barry 's name . Team Flash realizes that DeVoe is only stealing powers from metahumans who were on the bus when the dark matter wave was unleashed , which means he will likely target Ralph as well . Back at the DeVoes ' house , their marriage continues to deteriorate , and DeVoe drugs his wife with the Weeper 's tears to maintain her devotion towards him . 83 14 `` Subject 9 '' Ralph Hemecker Mike Alber & Gabe Snyder February 27 , 2018 ( 2018 - 02 - 27 ) T27. 13414 2.12 Barry is put on indefinite leave at the CCPD due to his connection with the DeVoe case .

Barry and Ralph help to train Izzy to refine her abilities , which proves difficult when she gets hurt . Eventually DeVoe shows up once again , using Dominic 's and Becky 's abilities to make Barry experience a brain aneurysm , while using Rundine 's abilities to incapacitate Ralph . DeVoe then once again uses the chair to transfer his mind into Izzy 's body and escapes . Both Ralph and Barry comfort each other over their respective losses : Barry being let go from the police force and Ralph losing Izzy to DeVoe . These losses enforce both Barry 's and Ralph 's determination to bring DeVoe down and save the three remaining metas . 84 15 `` Enter Flashtime '' Gregory Smith Todd Helbing & Sterling Gates March 6 , 2018 ( 2018 - 03 - 06 ) T27. 13415 2.04 Jesse comes to Earth - 1 to have a talk with her dad . Eco-terrorist Veronica Dale sets off a nuclear bomb , which Barry tries to stop , entering a form of superspeed known as Flashtime , where everything is frozen . However , the bomb has already detonated , and he and Jesse can not stop it or save everyone with superspeed . Jay Garrick comes from Earth - 3 to help , but they are still unable to stop it . Barry remains in Flashtime for hours , bringing each of his friends into it , in an attempt to find a solution ; they discuss options such as freezing it or sending it to another Earth , but none of those solutions prove to be viable . Eventually , Iris gives him the idea to retrieve the Quark Sphere from the Speed Force to send a blast lightning through the bomb , enough to disable it . Barry does so , and throws the Sphere back into the Speed Force , saving Central City . Jay admits he is retiring and going to train a new `` female '' speedster . Jesse and Jay return to their Earths , and Caitlin and Wells go for a coffee , where they encounter the mysterious girl . 85 16 `` Run , Iris , Run '' Harry Jierjian Eric Wallace March 13 , 2018 ( 2018 - 03 - 13 ) T27. 13416 2.09 A metahuman with fire powers tries to rob Central City bank .

Inspired by Thawne , Harry plans to build his own thinking cap to outwit DeVoe . With their roles reversed , Iris becomes Central City 's hero speedster , while Barry must learn to act as team leader . The new metahuman demands money and terrorizes the city with his fire powers . Using Wells ' thinking cap , the Team comes up with the idea for Iris to create a tidal wave , negating the flames and defeating the meta . Back at S.T.A.R. Labs , Kim touches Iris and Barry again , restoring the Flash 's speed . At home , Iris admits that while she did enjoy having superspeed , Central City needs the light that Barry was , and she is happy being team leader . Wells uses his thinking cap once more , determining the final two bus metas are Janet Petty and Edwin Gauss . 86 17 `` Null and Annoyed '' Kevin Smith Lauren Certo & Kristen Kim April 10 , 2018 ( 2018 - 04 - 10 ) T27. 13417 1.82 Barry and Ralph train to defeat DeVoe , with Barry becoming annoyed at Ralph 's apparent inability to be serious . The team manages to locate another bus meta , Janet Petty . When Barry and Ralph confront her , it is revealed that Petty can manipulate a person 's gravitational pull , which she demonstrates on Barry . Fearing once again that Ralph is not taking things seriously , Barry refuses to work with him . Ralph reveals his comedic attitude is due to a difficult childhood where his father abandoned him , causing him to make jokes whenever he is scared or under pressure . Barry relents and they go to stop Janet at a gala event . Janet uses her powers on Barry , causing him to float into the atmosphere . Barry tells the team to trust Ralph to improvise . Ralph detains Janet , then becomes a giant airbag to allow Barry to land safely . DeVoe 's wife discovers he has been drugging her , so she will continue to assist him .

The team rush back to Star Labs to regroup and heal . Caitlin reveals to Iris that Killer Frost is activated by her adrenal gland , and she is working on a way to separate them . Harry comes up with a tuning fork weapon that mimics Izzy 's abilities in order to defeat DeVoe . Ralph reveals to Barry that he is n't afraid of losing his own life , but of Team Flash losing theirs , as he considers them family . Wells is shown to be addicted to the Thinking Cap , which Joe helps him deal with . Ralph takes the fork , with the intent to go with Edwin to kill DeVoe , which Barry argues against . Eventually , DeVoe manages to take over Edwin 's mind , and as well takes the abilities of Janet Petty and Matthew Kim , before transferring his mind into Ralph 's body . The team try to stop him , but DeVoe incapacitates them , and alters Caitlin 's DNA , removing the dark matter and Killer Frost , before leaving . Back at his lair , DeVoe uses Ralph 's morphing abilities to morph back into his original form , while he and Marlize plan their next move to destroy Team Flash . 88 19 `` Fury Rogue '' Rachel Talalay Joshua V. Gilbert & Jeff Hersh April 24 , 2018 ( 2018 - 04 - 24 ) TBA 1.90 With DeVoe moving forwards with his plans , Team Flash decide to secure Neil Borman .

    "question": "where did the ashes from ash wednesday originate",
    "answer": "Ashes are ceremonially placed on the heads of Christians on Ash Wednesday , either by being sprinkled over their heads or , in English - speaking countries , more often by being marked on their foreheads as a visible cross . The words ( based on Genesis 3 : 19 ) used traditionally to accompany this gesture are , `` Memento , homo , quia pulvis es , et in pulverem reverteris . '' ( `` Remember , man , that thou art dust , and to dust thou shalt return . '' ) This custom is credited to Pope Gregory I the Great ( c. 540 -- 604 ) . In the 1969 revision of the Roman Rite , an alternative formula ( based on Mark 1 : 15 ) was introduced and given first place `` Repent , and believe in the Gospel '' and the older formula was translated as `` Remember that you are dust , and to dust you shall return . '' The old formula , based on the words spoken to Adam and Eve after their sin , reminds worshippers of their sinfulness and mortality and thus , implicitly , of their need to repent in time . The newer formula makes explicit what was only implicit in the old .<|answer_split|>Ashes were used in ancient times to express grief . When Tamar was raped by her half - brother , `` she sprinkled ashes on her head , tore her robe , and with her face buried in her hands went away crying '' ( 2 Samuel 13 : 19 ) . The gesture was also used to express sorrow for sins and faults . In Job 42 : 3 -- 6 , Job says to God : `` I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear : but now mine eye seeth thee . Wherefore I abhor myself , and repent in dust and ashes . '' The prophet Jeremiah calls for repentance by saying : `` O daughter of my people , gird on sackcloth , roll in the ashes '' ( Jer 6 : 26 ) . The prophet Daniel recounted pleading to God : `` I turned to the Lord God , pleading in earnest prayer , with fasting , sackcloth and ashes '' ( Daniel 9 : 3 ) . Just prior to the New Testament period , the rebels fighting for Jewish independence , the Maccabees , prepared for battle using ashes : `` That day they fasted and wore sackcloth ; they sprinkled ashes on their heads and tore their clothes '' ( 1 Maccabees 3 : 47 ; see also 4 : 39 ) .<|answer_split|>burning palm leaves from the previous year 's Palm Sunday celebrations<|answer_split|>Pope Gregory I the Great",

They help to address the problem of emitters of greenhouse gases not facing the full social cost of their actions .

    "question": "who rides so late through night and wind",
    "answer": "Wer reitet so spät durch Nacht und Wind ? Es ist der Vater mit seinem Kind ; Er hat den Knaben wohl in dem Arm , Er faßt ihn sicher , er hält ihn warm . `` Mein Sohn , was birgst du so bang dein Gesicht ? '' -- `` Siehst , Vater , du den Erlkönig nicht ? Den Erlenkönig mit Kron ' und Schweif ? '' -- `` Mein Sohn , es ist ein Nebelstreif . '' `` Du liebes Kind , komm , geh mit mir ! Gar schöne Spiele spiel ' ich mit dir ; Manch ' bunte Blumen sind an dem Strand , Meine Mutter hat manch gülden Gewand . '' -- `` Mein Vater , mein Vater , und hörest du nicht , Was Erlenkönig mir leise verspricht ? '' -- `` Sei ruhig , bleibe ruhig , mein Kind ; In dürren Blättern säuselt der Wind . '' -- `` Willst , feiner Knabe , du mit mir gehn ? Meine Töchter sollen dich warten schön ; Meine Töchter führen den nächtlichen Reihn , Und wiegen und tanzen und singen dich ein . '' -- `` Mein Vater , mein Vater , und siehst du nicht dort Erlkönigs Töchter am düstern Ort ? '' -- `` Mein Sohn , mein Sohn , ich seh ' es genau : Es scheinen die alten Weiden so grau . -- '' `` Ich liebe dich , mich reizt deine schöne Gestalt ; Und bist du nicht willig , so brauch ' ich Gewalt . '' -- `` Mein Vater , mein Vater , jetzt faßt er mich an ! Erlkönig hat mir ein Leids getan ! '' -- Dem Vater grauset 's ; er reitet geschwind , Er hält in Armen das ächzende Kind , Erreicht den Hof mit Mühe und Not ; In seinen Armen das Kind war tot . Who rides , so late , through night and wind ? It is the father with his child . He has the boy well in his arm He holds him safely , he keeps him warm . `` My son , why do you hide your face in fear ? '' `` Father , do you not see the Elf - king ? The Elf - king with crown and cape ? '' `` My son , it 's a streak of fog . '' `` You dear child , come , go with me ! ( Very ) beautiful games I play with you ; Many colorful flowers are on the beach , My mother has many a golden robe . '' `` My father , my father , and do you not hear What the Elf - king quietly promises me ? '' `` Be calm , stay calm , my child ; Through dry leaves the wind is sighing . '' `` Do you , fine boy , want to go with me ? My daughters shall wait on you finely ; My daughters lead the nightly dance , And rock and dance and sing to bring you in . '' `` My father , my father , and do n't you see there The Elf - king 's daughters in the gloomy place ? '' `` My son , my son , I see it clearly : There shimmer the old willows so grey . '' `` I love you , your beautiful form entices me ; And if you 're not willing , then I will use force . '' `` My father , my father , he 's touching me now ! The Elf - king has done me harm ! '' It horrifies the father ; he swiftly rides on , He holds the moaning child in his arms , Reaches the farm with great difficulty ; In his arms , the child was dead . Who rides there so late through the night dark and drear ? The father it is , with his infant so dear ; He holdeth the boy tightly clasp 'd in his arm , He holdeth him safely , he keepeth him warm . `` My son , wherefore seek'st thou thy face thus to hide ? '' `` Look , father , the Erl - King is close by our side ! Dost see not the Erl - King , with crown and with train ? '' `` My son , ' tis the mist rising over the plain . '' `` Oh , come , thou dear infant ! oh come thou with me ! For many a game I will play there with thee ; On my strand , lovely flowers their blossoms unfold , My mother shall grace thee with garments of gold . '' `` My father , my father , and dost thou not hear The words that the Erl - King now breathes in mine ear ? '' `` Be calm , dearest child , ' tis thy fancy deceives ; ' Tis the sad wind that sighs through the withering leaves . '' `` Wilt go , then , dear infant , wilt go with me there ? My daughters shall tend thee with sisterly care ; My daughters by night their glad festival keep , They 'll dance thee , and rock thee , and sing thee to sleep . '' `` My father , my father , and dost thou not see , How the Erl - King his daughters has brought here for me ? '' `` My darling , my darling , I see it aright , ' Tis the aged grey willows deceiving thy sight . '' `` I love thee , I 'm charm 'd by thy beauty , dear boy ! And if thou'rt unwilling , then force I 'll employ . '' `` My father , my father , he seizes me fast , For sorely the Erl - King has hurt me at last . '' The father now gallops , with terror half wild , He grasps in his arms the poor shuddering child ; He reaches his courtyard with toil and with dread , -- The child in his arms finds he motionless , dead .",

    "question": "why did france decide to aid the united states in its war for independence",
    "answer": "France bitterly resented its loss in the Seven Years ' War and sought revenge . It also wanted to strategically weaken Britain . Following the Declaration of Independence , the American Revolution was well received by both the general population and the aristocracy in France . The Revolution was perceived as the incarnation of the Enlightenment Spirit against the `` English tyranny . '' Benjamin Franklin traveled to France in December 1776 in order to rally the nation 's support , and he was welcomed with great enthusiasm . At first , French support was covert : French agents sent the Patriots military aid ( predominantly gunpowder ) through a company called Rodrigue Hortalez et Compagnie , beginning in the spring of 1776 . Estimates place the percentage of French supplied arms to the Americans in the Saratoga campaign at up to 90 % . By 1777 , over five million livres of aid had been sent to the American rebels .",

Rising artists Valens and Richardson had joined the tour , as well . The long journeys between venues on board the cold , uncomfortable tour buses adversely affected the performers , with cases of flu and even frostbite . After stopping at Clear Lake to perform , and frustrated by such conditions , Holly chose to charter a plane to reach their next venue in Moorhead , Minnesota . Richardson , who had the flu , swapped places with Jennings , taking his seat on the plane , while Allsup lost his seat to Valens on a coin toss . Soon after takeoff , late at night and in poor , wintry weather conditions , the pilot lost control of the light aircraft , a Beechcraft Bonanza , which subsequently crashed into a cornfield . Everyone on board was killed . The event has since been mentioned in various songs and films . A number of monuments have been erected at the crash site and in Clear Lake , where an annual memorial concert is also held at the Surf Ballroom , the venue that hosted the artists ' last performance .",

    "answer": "The region does not have specific boundaries , but is generally considered to include the 71 miles ( 114 km ) segment of California State Route 1 from Malpaso Creek near Carmel Highlands south to San Carpóforo Creek near San Simeon and the entire Santa Lucia range between the rivers . The interior region is uninhabited , while the coast remains relatively isolated and sparsely populated with about 1,000 year - round residents and relatively few visitor accommodations scattered among four small settlements . When the region was ceded by Mexico to the United States in 1848 , it was the United States ' `` last frontier . '' The region remained one of the most isolated areas of California and the United States until , after 18 years of construction , the Carmel -- San Simeon Highway ( now signed as part of State Route 1 ) was completed in 1937 . The winding , narrow road , often cut into the face of seaside cliffs , dominates the visitor 's experience of Big Sur . The highway has been closed more than 55 times by slides , and in May 2017 , a 2 million cubic foot landslide blocked the highway at Mud Creek , north of Salmon Creek near the San Luis Obispo border , to just south of Gorda . The road is expected to be reopened in June 2018 .<|answer_split|>does not have specific boundaries , but is generally considered to include the 71 miles ( 114 km ) segment of California State Route 1 from Malpaso Creek near Carmel Highlands south to San Carpóforo Creek near San Simeon and the entire Santa Lucia range between the rivers",

    "answer": "The polar bear ( Ursus maritimus ) is a carnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle , encompassing the Arctic Ocean , its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses . It is a large bear , approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear ( Ursus arctos middendorffi ) . A boar ( adult male ) weighs around 350 -- 700 kg ( 772 -- 1,543 lb ) , while a sow ( adult female ) is about half that size . Although it is the sister species of the brown bear , it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche , with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures , for moving across snow , ice and open water , and for hunting seals , which make up most of its diet . Although most polar bears are born on land , they spend most of their time on the sea ice . Their scientific name means `` maritime bear '' and derives from this fact . Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice , often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present . Because of their dependence on the sea ice , polar bears are classified as marine mammals .",
